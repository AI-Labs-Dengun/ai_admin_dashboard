    fullChat:
      "User: How do I determine the value of a 3-bedroom house in downtown?\n\nAI: There are several methods to determine property value. For a 3-bedroom house in downtown, I recommend looking at comparable sales in the area from the last 6 months. You should also consider factors like square footage, lot size, condition, and special features. Would you like me to explain each valuation method in detail?\n\nUser: Yes, please explain the comparative market analysis approach.\n\nAI: The Comparative Market Analysis (CMA) approach involves finding similar properties that have recently sold in your area. Here's how to do it:\n\n1. Identify 3-5 similar properties that sold in the last 3-6 months\n2. Adjust for differences (add value for features your property has that comps don't, subtract for features comps have that yours doesn't)\n3. Calculate the average adjusted price\n\nThis gives you a market-based valuation that's often quite accurate for residential properties in active markets. Would you like me to explain other approaches as well?",

To provide the most relevant analysis, could you specify which geographic region you're interested in?\n\nUser: The Northeast region, particularly around Boston.\n\nAI: Here's my analysis of the suburban residential market around Boston:\n\nCurrent Market Conditions:\n- Median home prices have increased 7% year-over-year\n- Average days on market: 12 (down from 18 last year)\n- Inventory levels are at 1.8 months (6 months is considered balanced)\n- Bidding wars occurring on approximately 40% of listings\n\nKey Drivers:\n- Continued remote/hybrid work policies allowing more flexibility in home location\n- Migration from urban Boston to suburbs seeking more space\n- Limited new construction due to supply chain issues and zoning restrictions\n- Historically low interest rates (though rising gradually)\n\nHottest Suburbs:\n- Newton, Lexington, and Wellesley showing strongest price appreciation (9-11% YoY)\n- Natick and Framingham offering slightly better value with good school districts\n\nPredictions for Next 12 Months:\n- Continued price growth but at a more moderate pace (4-6%)\n- Gradual increase in inventory as more sellers enter the market\n- Rising interest rates may cool demand slightly but not significantly\n\nWould you like me to elaborate on any specific aspect of this analysis?",

There's also a backyard with a small pool.\n\nAI: Here's a detailed shot list for your mid-century modern home photography session:\n\nExterior Shots:\n1. Front elevation - straight-on view capturing the architectural lines (morning or late afternoon for best light)\n2. Front angle view - showing depth and dimension of the facade\n3. Backyard overview - highlighting the pool area\n4. Pool detail shot - close-up of water feature or interesting angle\n5. Any outdoor living spaces or patios\n6. Architectural details unique to mid-century design (roof lines, decorative elements)\n\nInterior Shots:\n7.
